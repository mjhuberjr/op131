# opertation thirteenOne's Website
This website is built using the [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor) web framework.

## Setup
Being a pretty simple website that will not be taking a lot of daily changes, I've decided not to build this as an actual web app. All database entries are handled locally before being secure transfered to my server.
